    In the United States, the limited availability of licensed sterile compounding pharmacies poses a significant challenge to patients and healthcare providers. In California, for example, the state‚Äôs 39 million residents have access to only 70 licensed pharmacies authorized to provide sterile compounded drugs. This scarcity has led some patients to seek medications from unsafe or illegal sources, including black market drugs, research chemicals not intended for human use, or unlicensed drugs transported across state lines from regions with less stringent regulations.

    Such practices expose both patients and pharmacists to serious health risks and legal repercussions, further straining an already vulnerable healthcare system.
